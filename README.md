# Cartography of Memory

This project began with a question I've been thinking about since moving to New York last year: How much of this place has changed? How much have I changed? Growing up in Singapore, my family visited New York twice - once in 2011 and again in 2014. Now that I live here, those memories feel distant and dreamlike, as if they belong to someone else. This piece became a way to explore how time, place, and perspective intertwine.

It's for anyone who's looked back at their childhood and realized how differently they once saw the world - immigrants, people who've moved cities, or anyone who's felt the dissonance between memory and reality. I built this as a simple website to keep it intimate, like flipping through a digital photo album but also so that my family could experience it from across the world.

Technically, it's made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The memories appear as heart markers on an interactive map built with Leaflet.js, each revealing photos and sounds from our trips. Flowing red SVG lines connect these points - threads of memory that weave across time and space. As you explore, hidden links slowly emerge; only after visiting every spot can you zoom out to see them all pulsing together like a heartbeat - an echo of how separate moments eventually form a larger story.

Debussy's Arabesque plays in the background, giving the piece a hazy, nostalgic rhythm. Each location has its own ambient audio, immersing you in the soundscape of that place. The photos come from my 2011 and 2014 Facebook albums, preserved fragments of a younger perspective.

Through this project, I'm exploring how digital tools can visualize the fluidity of memory - how meaning shifts as we grow, and how time reframes our sense of place. My goal is for viewers to feel what it's like to stand between two versions of themselves, and ask: how has time changed our perception of a place, and how has a place changed our understanding of time?

## How to Experience

1. Click the bouncing cloud emoji to begin
